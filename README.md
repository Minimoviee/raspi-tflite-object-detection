# Object Detection using a Raspberry Pi 4 and TensorFlow Lite
With optional Google Coral.ai USB AI Accelerator (Edge TPU co-processor)  

## Description  
This is a project for EE 45900 - Microprocessors - Spring 2020 at The City College of New York. In this project we will use a Raspberry Pi to create a Real-Time Object Detector.  
Group members: Kelvin Ma and YoungHwa Min  
  
We will be using a [Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB) model](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb) and [Coral's USB Accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator) along with [TensorFlow-Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)  This project will be open source and open to modification. In fact, it was made possible by many examples and open source code. We have provided credit in the code depending on the resources. Our own original code will also be open source to all, we only ask that you provide credit.
